==========
elpa cache
==========

This is just a check-in of a very curated elpa directory, meant to be used as
a subdirectory for my `.emacs.d <https://github.com/tychoish/.emacs.d/>`_, and
only then as a bootstrap to facilate quick loadtimes for new users.

It's probably best to ignore this and not think about it too much. :)
