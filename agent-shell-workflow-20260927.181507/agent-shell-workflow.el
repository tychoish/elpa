;;; Commentary:

;; `agent-shell-workflow' registers reusable, parameterized prompt
;; workflows: an optional deterministic pre-operation gathers context
;; (CI logs, diffs, PR comments) before an agent turn; the prompt
;; template renders that context into text; an optional post-operation
;; reacts to turn completion (verification, cleanup, chaining).
;;
;; Workflows dispatch either directly to a live or new `agent-shell'
;; session, or as a queued item in `agent-shell-queue'.  See
;; `register-agent-shell-workflow' to register a workflow and
;; `agent-shell-workflow-dispatch' to run one.
