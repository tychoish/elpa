;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `agent-shell-chat-mode' relabels the shell so it reads like a chat:
;; each submitted user turn is boxed `Me' and each response is boxed with
;; the agent's name.  Labels are overlays, so the buffer text is untouched
;; (a `display' overlay replaces the visible comint prompt for `Me', and a
;; `before-string' overlay renders the agent label at the invisible
;; `<shell-maker-end-of-prompt>' marker).
;;
;; The live prompt awaiting input shows `Me' too, so you can type straight
;; into the shell.  When `agent-shell-prompt-bar-mode' is enabled, input
;; flows through that bar instead, so the live prompt is hidden.
;;
;; Toggle it with `M-x agent-shell-chat-mode'.

  "Ensure a TAG overlay spans BEG..END carrying PROPS.

TAG is a symbol naming what the overlay is for (`me', `agent' and so
on), held in an `agent-shell-chat--tag' property of its own rather
than in `category': a `category' hands redisplay every property its
symbol carries, so a value that also names a face lends its internal face
id and floods `*Messages*' with \"Invalid face reference\".  A property
of our own carries nothing.

PROPS is an alist of overlay property to value.  Reuses an existing TAG
overlay overlapping ANCHOR-BEG..ANCHOR-END (moving it when the span
changed), otherwise creates one.  Reusing, and writing only what
changed, leaves an unchanged buffer untouched: relabeling runs on every
agent event, and each overlay write dirties its span for redisplay.

Writing only what it is handed also means a reused overlay keeps every
property PROPS leaves out, whoever wrote it.  A caller drawing a label
therefore spells out both of the properties a label can be drawn with
\(`display' and `before-string'), including the one it does not use, so
that relabeling heals an overlay a differently drawn label left behind
\(see `agent-shell-chat--label-rows').

ANCHOR-BEG..ANCHOR-END default to the span, and are widened only where
an overlay is expected to sit somewhere its span no longer covers.

With REAR-ADVANCE non-nil the overlay takes in text inserted at its end,
so it can hold properties over an input still being typed: relabeling is
event-driven, so an overlay that stopped at the caret would never grow
to cover what follows it."

screen, and `buffer-substring' alone cannot: overlays are not text.

Only chat mode's own overlays are substituted, found by the
`agent-shell-chat--tag' they already carry.  That keeps this out of the
business of resolving overlapping overlays by priority, and means an
image `display' put here by anything else is never stringified.
