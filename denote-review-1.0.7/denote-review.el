;;; Commentary:

;; `denote-review' aims to provide a practical and simple manner to
;; implement a review process for your denote notes.

;; It is soleley made for denote notes in org mode format with the
;; default filenaming scheme.

;; `denote-review' adds a single line to the frontmatter, f.e.:
;; #+reviewdate: [2024-06-12]

;; In `tabulated list mode' the notes are shown with their last
;; review date, sorted from oldest to newest review date.
;; Click on a column header to change the order.

;; See the README for full explanation and the manual:
;; Evaluate:
;;   (info "(denote-review) Top")
