(defun agent-shell--dnd-handle-file-url (urls _action)
  "Attach the local files behind dropped URLS as file context.

A `dnd-protocol-alist' handler: files dropped on the buffer attach to
the prompt the way `agent-shell-yank-dwim' attaches a clipboard image,
instead of opening in the window.  URLS is the list of file: URLs in
the drop, or a single URL on Emacs 29, which calls handlers once per
file.  ACTION is ignored.  Returns `private', the action Emacs expects
a handler to report.

Every file is checked before any is copied, so a drop that includes an
unreadable file or a directory attaches nothing rather than part of the
selection.  A drop made while the shell is mid-turn is queued, the way
`agent-shell-send-region' queues its region, whether it lands on the
shell or on a viewport buffer.

For example, dropping \"file:///tmp/diagram.png\" and
\"file:///tmp/notes.txt\" together inserts \"@/tmp/diagram.png\" with
an image preview and \"@/tmp/notes.txt\"."

;; Emacs 30+ reads the dnd-multiple-handler property off the handler's
;; symbol before each drop.  When it is non-nil,
;; `dnd-handle-multiple-urls' calls the handler just once, passing every
;; URL in the drop together, so several files become one insertion and
;; one busy check.  Emacs 29 never reads this property, so setting it
;; has no effect there: the handler is called per URL with a single
;; string, which the ensure-list above absorbs.

  "Return FILE, or a copy of it that outlives the drop when FILE is transient.

A file promised by the drag source rather than dragged from disk (a
screenshot thumbnail, an image dragged out of a browser) is written
under the variable `temporary-file-directory' for the duration of the
drag and deleted once it ends, so it is copied into the screenshots
directory first.  Any other file is returned as is, and so is a file
under PROJECT-DIR: a project that itself lives in the temporary
directory (see `agent-shell-new-temp-shell') drags its own files,
which are not going anywhere.

For example:

  \"/var/folders/.../T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_x/Shot.png\"
  => \"<project>/.agent-shell/screenshots/dropped-20260913-081512-Ab3xK9.png\"

Only the local file: forms Emacs itself routes to `dnd-open-local-file'
are taken; a \"file://HOST/...\" URL still reaches `dnd-open-file'.
