;;; Commentary:

;; The registry is elastic and often site/config-specific, so the
;; interactive surface is a single `annotated-completing-read' picker
;; (`agent-shell-prompt-select') rather than a bespoke transient menu
;; per prompt.  `agent-shell-prompt-dispatch-menu' wires exactly one
;; entry point into `agent-shell-menu-dispatch' that calls the picker.
